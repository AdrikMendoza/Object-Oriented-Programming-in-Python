# Object Oriented Programming in Python

Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a widely used programming paradigm that reduces development timesâ€”making it easier to read, reuse, and maintain your code. OOP shifts the focus from thinking about code as a sequence of actions to looking at your program as a collection of objects that interact with each other.
